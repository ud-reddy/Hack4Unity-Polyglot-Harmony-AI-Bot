# 🌍 Polyglot Harmony AI Bot

### _Where languages blend. Cultures connect. Conversations flow._

## 🎤 Inspiration

As international master’s students, we juggle multiple languages daily. We think in one, speak in another, and sometimes mix three without even noticing. But English — even when we’re fluent — doesn’t always carry our emotions or cultural warmth.

**Polyglot Harmony AI Bot** was created to help people communicate naturally, in their own voice, without linguistic friction.  
A tool that understands how _we_ speak — not how a textbook expects us to.
